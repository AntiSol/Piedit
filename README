Piedit is a Graphical IDE and integrated interpreter for the Piet programming language.

Piet is an esoteric programming language inspired by Piet Mondrian, where the programs look like abstract art. The colours and arrangement of the pixels control the program flow and operation. For a more detailed explanation, see the Piet Homepage.

Written in Python with a GTK interface designed in Glade.
