Piedit is a Graphical IDE and integrated interpreter for the Piet programming language http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html.

Piet is an esoteric programming language inspired by Piet Mondrian - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian, where the programs look like abstract art. The colours and arrangement of the pixels control the program flow and operation. For a more detailed explanation, see the Piet Homepage (link above).

Written in Python with a GTK interface designed in Glade.

Features

    * Create, edit and save Piet programs easily using the UI
    * Run programs using the command line interpreter
    * Step through/run programs in the UI
    * There seemed like a lot more features when I was writing it! 

Program Requirements

    * Python2 (with PIL)
    * GTK+ 2.0
    * PyGTK bindings 

Running in docker:

Python2 is no longer supported, and pygtk (gtk2) is not supported in python3, so it would seem that the best
 way to run piedit on a modern system is via docker. This repo contains scripts to allow that.

To run, simply ensure you have docker installer and use ./run.sh to build and start the program.
